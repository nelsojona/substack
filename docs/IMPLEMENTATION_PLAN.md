# Implementation Plan for Next Sprint (March 15-29, 2025)

## Completed Tasks

The following high-priority tasks have been completed in the current sprint:

- INT-2: Add support for fetching post comments
- INT-3: Implement newsletter metadata extraction
- INT-5: Implement concurrent fetching for improved performance
- INT-6: Add support for exporting subscriber-only content

All these features have been fully implemented and comprehensive tests have been written for each:

- `tests/test_comment_extraction.py`: Tests for comment extraction functionality
- `tests/test_newsletter_metadata.py`: Tests for newsletter metadata extraction
- `tests/test_concurrent_fetching.py`: Tests for concurrent fetching and connection pooling
- `tests/test_subscriber_content.py`: Tests for subscriber-only content access
- `tests/test_integration.py`: End-to-end integration tests for all features working together

## Current Focus

Based on the TASKS.md file, all the INT tasks (INT-1 through INT-8) have been completed. The next logical focus should be on the Extended Features (EXT tasks) that have not yet been started:

- EXT-1: Add support for custom Markdown templates
- EXT-2: Implement batch processing for multiple authors
- EXT-3: Add support for filtering posts by date range
- EXT-4: Implement export to other formats (e.g., PDF, HTML)
- EXT-6: Integrate with Oxylabs for proxying requests

## Next Tasks

For the next sprint, we recommend focusing on the following tasks in order of priority:

1. **EXT-2: Implement batch processing for multiple authors** (Medium priority, 1d effort)
   - Create a batch configuration file format (JSON/YAML)
   - Implement parallel processing of multiple authors
   - Add CLI option for batch processing
   - Update documentation with batch processing examples

2. **EXT-3: Add support for filtering posts by date range** (Medium priority, 0.5d effort)
   - Add CLI arguments for date filtering (--start-date, --end-date)
   - Implement filter logic in post discovery
   - Update sitemap parsing to respect date filters
   - Add date filtering to the API-based fetching methods

3. **EXT-6: Integrate with Oxylabs for proxying requests** (Medium priority, 1d effort)
   - Implement proxy configuration via environment variables
   - Add proxy support to connection pool
   - Create proxy rotation mechanism
   - Add documentation for proxy setup

4. **EXT-1: Add support for custom Markdown templates** (Low priority, 1d effort)
   - Design template format with variables for post metadata
   - Implement template loading and parsing
   - Add CLI option for specifying template file
   - Create example templates

5. **EXT-4: Implement export to other formats** (Low priority, 2d effort)
   - Add PDF export using a library like WeasyPrint
   - Add HTML export with customizable styling
   - Implement EPUB export for e-readers
   - Add CLI options for format selection

## Technical Recommendations

Based on the implementation experience so far, we recommend the following technical improvements:

1. **Refactor the authentication module**
   - Create a dedicated authentication module to better handle token refresh
   - Implement more robust error handling for authentication failures
   - Add support for different authentication methods (token, cookies, email/password)

2. **Improve error handling strategy**
   - Implement more granular error types for different failure scenarios
   - Add better recovery mechanisms for network failures
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for API calls

3. **Enhance logging system**
   - Add structured logging for better analysis
   - Implement log rotation to prevent large log files
   - Add more detailed logging for debugging complex issues

4. **Consider implementing a plugin system**
   - Create a plugin architecture for custom post processors
   - Allow for extensibility without modifying core code
   - Enable community contributions for specialized features

## Timeline

- March 15-17: Implement EXT-2 (Batch processing for multiple authors)
- March 18-19: Implement EXT-3 (Filtering posts by date range)
- March 20-22: Implement EXT-6 (Oxylabs integration)
- March 23-25: Implement EXT-1 (Custom Markdown templates)
- March 26-29: Begin work on EXT-4 (Export to other formats)

## Dependencies and Blockers

- Need to add more test coverage for edge cases in authentication
- Consider upgrading aiohttp to the latest version for better performance
- May need to add more documentation for the Oxylabs integration

## Testing Strategy

For each new feature, we will continue to follow the comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Verify component behavior with different inputs
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify data flow through multiple components
   - Test API integration points

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Verify application behavior across multiple components
   - Test critical user journeys

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Test loading times and resource usage
   - Verify performance with large datasets
   - Test concurrency handling

## Documentation Updates

For each implemented feature, we will update:

1. **README.md**
   - Add usage examples for new features
   - Update command-line arguments section
   - Add explanations of new functionality

2. **TASKS.md**
   - Update task status as features are completed
   - Add new tasks as they are identified

3. **Code Documentation**
   - Add docstrings to all new functions and classes
   - Update existing documentation as needed
   - Add comments for complex logic

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, we will continue to make steady progress on the Substack to Markdown CLI tool, focusing on the most valuable features first while maintaining high code quality and comprehensive test coverage.
