- `tests/test_integration.py`: End-to-end integration tests for all features working together

## Current Status

Based on the TASKS.md file, all the INT tasks (INT-1 through INT-8) and most of the EXT tasks have been completed. The project has made significant progress, with all high-priority features now implemented and tested.

## Recent Implementations

### EXT-1: Custom Markdown Templates

We have successfully implemented custom Markdown templates:

1. **Created a template manager module**
   - Implemented `src/utils/template_manager.py` with the `TemplateManager` class
   - Added support for loading templates from a directory
   - Implemented template parsing and variable substitution using Python's string.Template

2. **Added CLI support**
   - Updated `main.py` to add a new "template" command for managing templates
   - Added command-line arguments for template selection in the direct downloader
   - Implemented a helper function to create example templates

3. **Integrated with the downloader**
   - Modified `SubstackDirectDownloader` to support template-based output
   - Added template-related parameters to the constructor
   - Updated the post download process to use templates for formatting

4. **Added comprehensive tests**
   - Created `tests/test_template_manager.py` with unit tests for all functionality
   - Tested template loading, parsing, and application
   - Added tests for error handling and edge cases

5. **Updated documentation**
   - Added custom templates section to README.md
   - Updated TASKS.md to mark EXT-1 as completed

The custom templates feature allows users to customize the format and structure of the generated Markdown files, making it easier to integrate with different publishing platforms or personal workflows.

### EXT-4: Export to Other Formats

We have successfully implemented export to other formats:

1. **Created a format converter module**
   - Implemented `src/utils/format_converter.py` with the `FormatConverter` class
   - Added support for HTML, PDF, and EPUB formats
   - Implemented integration with Pandoc for format conversion

2. **Added CLI support**
   - Updated `main.py` to add a new "convert" command
   - Added command-line arguments for format selection and conversion options
   - Implemented dependency checking for external tools

3. **Implemented format-specific features**
   - Added CSS styling for HTML and PDF output
   - Implemented metadata handling for all formats
   - Added support for cover images in EPUB output

4. **Added comprehensive tests**
   - Created `tests/test_format_converter.py` with unit tests for all functionality
   - Tested conversion to different formats
   - Added tests for error handling and dependency checking

5. **Updated documentation**
   - Added format conversion section to README.md
   - Updated TASKS.md to mark EXT-4 as completed

The format conversion feature allows users to export Markdown files to other formats like HTML, PDF, and EPUB, making it easier to share content in different contexts or publish to different platforms.

## Next Tasks

For the next sprint, we recommend focusing on the following tasks:

1. **Implement a unified configuration system**
   - Create a centralized configuration module
   - Support loading configuration from files, environment variables, and command-line arguments
   - Add validation and documentation for configuration options

2. **Enhance the CLI interface**
   - Implement a more consistent command structure
   - Add better help documentation
   - Implement tab completion for commands and options

3. **Improve error reporting and logging**
   - Implement structured logging
   - Add better error messages and recovery suggestions
   - Create a log viewer/analyzer tool

4. **Create a web interface**
   - Implement a simple web UI for the tool
   - Add support for managing downloads through the web interface
   - Implement real-time progress reporting

## Technical Recommendations

Based on the implementation experience so far, we recommend the following technical improvements:

1. **Refactor the authentication module**
   - Create a dedicated authentication module to better handle token refresh
   - Implement more robust error handling for authentication failures
   - Add support for different authentication methods (token, cookies, email/password)

2. **Improve error handling strategy**
   - Implement more granular error types for different failure scenarios
   - Add better recovery mechanisms for network failures
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for API calls

3. **Enhance logging system**
   - Add structured logging for better analysis
   - Implement log rotation to prevent large log files
   - Add more detailed logging for debugging complex issues

4. **Consider implementing a plugin system**
   - Create a plugin architecture for custom post processors
   - Allow for extensibility without modifying core code
   - Enable community contributions for specialized features

## Timeline

- March 10: Completed EXT-1 (Custom Markdown templates)
- March 10: Completed EXT-4 (Export to other formats)
- March 16-20: Implement unified configuration system
- March 21-25: Enhance CLI interface
- March 26-30: Improve error reporting and logging

## Dependencies and Blockers

- Need to add more test coverage for edge cases in authentication
- Consider upgrading aiohttp to the latest version for better performance
- May need to add more documentation for the format conversion feature
- Need to ensure the template system works well with different Markdown flavors

## Testing Strategy

For each new feature, we will continue to follow the comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Verify component behavior with different inputs
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify data flow through multiple components
   - Test API integration points

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Verify application behavior across multiple components
   - Test critical user journeys

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Test loading times and resource usage
   - Verify performance with large datasets
   - Test concurrency handling

## Documentation Updates

For each implemented feature, we will update:

1. **README.md**
   - Add usage examples for new features
   - Update command-line arguments section
   - Add explanations of new functionality

2. **TASKS.md**
   - Update task status as features are completed
   - Add new tasks as they are identified

3. **Code Documentation**
   - Add docstrings to all new functions and classes
   - Update existing documentation as needed
   - Add comments for complex logic

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, we will continue to make steady progress on the Substack to Markdown CLI tool, focusing on the most valuable features first while maintaining high code quality and comprehensive test coverage. The recent completion of custom templates and format conversion features represents significant progress toward a more flexible and powerful tool.
