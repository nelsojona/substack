## Current Focus

Based on the TASKS.md file, all the INT tasks (INT-1 through INT-8) have been completed, and we've now completed EXT-2 (batch processing for multiple authors) and EXT-3 (filtering posts by date range). The next logical focus should be on the remaining Extended Features (EXT tasks) that have not yet been started:

- EXT-1: Add support for custom Markdown templates
- EXT-4: Implement export to other formats (e.g., PDF, HTML)
- EXT-6: Integrate with Oxylabs for proxying requests

## Next Tasks

For the next sprint, we recommend focusing on the following tasks in order of priority:

1. **EXT-1: Add support for custom Markdown templates** (Low priority, 1d effort)
   - Design template format with variables for post metadata
   - Implement template loading and parsing
   - Add CLI option for specifying template file
   - Create example templates

3. **EXT-4: Implement export to other formats** (Low priority, 2d effort)
   - Add PDF export using a library like WeasyPrint
   - Add HTML export with customizable styling
   - Implement EPUB export for e-readers
   - Add CLI options for format selection

## Technical Recommendations

Based on the implementation experience so far, we recommend the following technical improvements:

1. **Refactor the authentication module**
   - Create a dedicated authentication module to better handle token refresh
   - Implement more robust error handling for authentication failures
   - Add support for different authentication methods (token, cookies, email/password)

2. **Improve error handling strategy**
   - Implement more granular error types for different failure scenarios
   - Add better recovery mechanisms for network failures
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern for API calls

3. **Enhance logging system**

   - Add more detailed logging for debugging complex issues

4. **Consider implementing a plugin system**
   - Create a plugin architecture for custom post processors
   - Allow for extensibility without modifying core code
   - Enable community contributions for specialized features

## Timeline

- March 10: Completed EXT-3 (Filtering posts by date range)
- March 10: Completed EXT-6 (Oxylabs integration)
- March 15-18: Implement EXT-1 (Custom Markdown templates)
- March 19-26: Begin work on EXT-4 (Export to other formats)

## Dependencies and Blockers

- Need to add more test coverage for edge cases in authentication
- Consider upgrading aiohttp to the latest version for better performance
- May need to add more documentation for the Oxylabs integration
- Need to ensure the batch processor works well with large numbers of authors

## Testing Strategy

For each new feature, we will continue to follow the comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Verify component behavior with different inputs
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify data flow through multiple components
   - Test API integration points

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Verify application behavior across multiple components
   - Test critical user journeys

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Test loading times and resource usage
   - Verify performance with large datasets
   - Test concurrency handling

## Completed Implementations

### EXT-6: Oxylabs Integration

We have successfully implemented Oxylabs proxy integration (EXT-6):

1. **Created a proxy handler module**
   - Implemented `src/utils/proxy_handler.py` with the `OxylabsProxyHandler` class
   - Added support for all Oxylabs proxy configuration options (country, city, state, session)
   - Implemented methods for different proxy usage scenarios (urllib, requests, aiohttp)

2. **Added proxy support to connection pool**
   - Updated `src/utils/connection_pool.py` to support proxy configuration
   - Integrated proxy with aiohttp sessions
   - Added proxy support to the OptimizedHttpClient class

3. **Integrated with environment variables**
   - Leveraged existing `env_loader.py` module for loading proxy configuration
   - Added fallback to environment variables when proxy config is not provided directly

4. **Updated the downloader class**
   - Modified `SubstackDirectDownloader` to support proxy configuration
   - Added proxy-related command-line arguments
   - Implemented validation and fallback mechanisms for proxy configuration

   - Tested proxy URL building with various configuration options
   - Added tests for integration with connection pool and downloader
   - Implemented tests for environment variable integration

6. **Updated documentation**
   - Updated TASKS.md to mark EXT-6 as completed
   - Updated this implementation plan to reflect the completed work

The Oxylabs proxy integration allows users to route requests through different IP addresses, which helps avoid rate limiting and access geo-restricted content. The implementation supports all Oxylabs proxy features including country/city selection, session persistence, and configuration via environment variables.

### EXT-2: Batch Processing

We have successfully implemented batch processing for multiple authors (EXT-2):

1. **Created a batch processor module**
   - Implemented `src/utils/batch_processor.py` with the `BatchProcessor` class
   - Added support for both JSON and YAML configuration formats
   - Implemented parallel processing using Python's multiprocessing

2. **Added CLI support**
   - Updated `main.py` to add a new "batch" command
   - Added command-line arguments for batch processing
   - Implemented a helper function to create example configuration files

3. **Added comprehensive tests**
   - Created `tests/test_batch_processor.py` with unit tests for all functionality
   - Tested configuration loading, validation, and processing

1. **Added CLI arguments for date filtering**
   - Implemented `--start-date` and `--end-date` arguments in the CLI
   - Added proper date parsing and validation
   - Updated help documentation to explain the date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

2. **Implemented filter logic in post discovery**
   - Added a `_is_post_in_date_range` method to check if posts are within the specified date range
   - Updated sitemap parsing to respect date filters using the `lastmod` element
   - Added date filtering to the post download process

3. **Added comprehensive tests**
   - Created `tests/test_date_filtering.py` with unit tests for all functionality
   - Tested date parsing, validation, and filtering logic
   - Added tests for both sitemap-based and direct fetching methods

4. **Updated documentation**
   - Added date filtering section to README.md
   - Updated command-line arguments table to include the new date filtering options
   - Updated TASKS.md to mark EXT-3 as completed
   - Updated this implementation plan to reflect the completed work

The date filtering feature allows users to download only posts published within a specific date range, making it easier to archive or process posts from a particular time period.

## Documentation Updates

For each implemented feature, we will update:

1. **README.md**
   - Add usage examples for new features
   - Update command-line arguments section
   - Add explanations of new functionality

2. **TASKS.md**
   - Update task status as features are completed
